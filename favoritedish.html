        <p>should be the only words I use to describe my favorite dish. However, I would be doing my favorite dish a truly unjust servitude. I felt special eating such a dish thus that is why I love to brag about the night. I'm determined to one day make my own version of the meal and I know I can make my rival that of the chef at The Little Door resturant in Santa Barbara. The amount of flavoring that went into each bite was worthy of its own seen in Ratatouille</p>
